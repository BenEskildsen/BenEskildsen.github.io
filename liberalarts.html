			<h1>The Decline of the Liberal Arts Education at Yale</h1>
			<h3>2/6/2014</h3>
			<p>
			I had a conversation at lunch recently with a senior computer science major. As I am also a computer science major, I asked him if he had any classes he would recommend, thinking he would tell me which CS electives he thought were good. Instead, he told me that all his favorite classes had been outside his major -- the hallmark of a good liberal arts education. 
		</p> <p>

The purported advantage that a liberal arts school has over a more technical school like MIT or Carnegie Mellon is that students are exposed to a wider array of fields and ideas, and thus not stuck with a major they chose when they applied, and only classes in their major and closely related fields. The theory goes that, while on paper any graduate from a technical school will look more qualified than their peers at a liberal arts school, the arts grad is prepared for anything, not just the one thing. So an employer that wants a well-rounded, analytical, go-getter should hire someone from a liberal arts school. Because even if the liberal arts grad has less technical knowledge, they should have the skills to quickly pick up whatever they need while on the job. 
</p> <p>
So when that senior I was eating lunch with told me about his favorite classes and how they were outside his major, it at first seemed like a good thing: new perspectives, broadening horizons, that whole deal. What really got me thinking, though, was when he said that “liberal arts is all about applying things to other things”. And it seems like, at least at Yale, and especially within the STEM fields, “applying things to other things” would be better said as “applying things to getting a job”. Maybe it’s just the culture of (STEM at) Yale that students seem more obsessed with what job to get after they graduate than with learning any thing in particular, but I’m going to try to argue that liberal arts itself is at least partially to blame for this pre-professional atmosphere.
</p> <p>
I had the chance to meet a few computer science majors at Carnegie Mellon a couple months ago. Them being from a technical school, I was prepared to look down on them for being obsessed with getting a job; for only caring about computer science as a means to an end and not a engaging field in and of itself. But what surprised me was that, if anything, they cared more about the theoretical and academic aspects of computer science than anyone I’ve met at Yale.
</p> <p>
At Yale, I constantly hear complaints from my peers along the lines of “they’re not teaching us anything useful in these computer science classes. We need to learn web frameworks and big data manipulation” because that’s where the jobs are right now. The Carnegie Mellon students, on the other hand, talked with me about the cool theoretical things they were learning in their CS classes and how fascinating they were in their own right. If the classical argument for liberal arts is that people at technical schools just want a job, while people at liberal arts schools value learning for its own sake, what’s going on?
</p> <p>
Here’s my theory. The future is scary. It’s not fun not having a plan. And so students at Yale and other liberal arts schools, given instructions upon arrival by the president of the college to explore with abandon, try new things, and generally do whatever we want, can feel purposeless and scared. What will become of us after we graduate? With no specific end-goal job waiting for us at the end, every class we take and activity we do needs to have some sort of direct application to our near future because without a plan, we feel at risk of having nothing. The Carnegie Mellon students, though, know that when they graduate from the best school for undergraduate computer science in the country, a job should just fall into place. And in the meantime, they can really explore the field and learn without having to worry about immediate applications. Counter-intuitively, the technical school has provided a better environment for learning for its own sake than the liberal arts school!
</p> <p>
Of course, one could argue that Yale students need not worry about jobs either, but we do worry, which means that whether or not our fears are grounded in reality, the perception is what matters. And what about students at liberal arts schools that don’t have the guaranteed name-recognition of a Yale or Harvard, etc. I wonder if this obsession with applying things to getting a job is a problem everywhere (certainly, if it’s not, then my argument is invalid). 
</p> <p>
So what can we do? Maybe us liberal arts students are right to be nervous about the future. Without marketable skills and impeccable resumes, why would an employer hire us over the Carnegie Mellon grad? But that’s a false argument, because right now, the employer should hire the graduate from a technical school over the career-obsessed Yale grad. Since only one of them cares about learning for its own sake -- the, to me, litmus test of effectiveness and potential success -- and it’s not the Yalie. 
</p> <p>
Look, I’m not even really trying to argue against liberal arts itself. It’s our attitude towards it that needs to change. When it comes to learning for its own sake, Yale definitely provides more opportunities than practically anywhere else. Uncertainty is scary, and if liberal arts provides anything, it’s not certainty, but we have to embrace it. Embrace the uncertainty of the future (we can’t control it no matter what), embrace the computer science classes that don’t let you tick off a box on an application, and embrace all the other classes that have nothing to do with “real life”. Liberal arts hasn’t given up on us, we’ve given up on it.
