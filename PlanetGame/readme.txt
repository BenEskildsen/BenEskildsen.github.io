All questions run on Mac OS X Version 10.9.4 (Mavericks) on 64 bit Chrome Version 45.0.2452.85

I was bad and copied my code into the folders AFTER solving each problem. So every js folder
within each question contains the code to solve all the problems. I tried to go in and configure
each js folder to display the feature of the question out of the box, but it may be kind of
weird. To help, I tried to put comments like

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Assignment 6 q2
....the code....
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////

around each of my solutions. Hopefully that helps with grading.
