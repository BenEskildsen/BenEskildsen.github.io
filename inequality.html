			<h1>Response to an Article Arguing in Favor of Income Inequality</h1>
			<h3>5/11/2014</h3>
		
One of my many goals for this summer is to update this blog more often (if I put online that I want to update it once per week, does that make me more accountable?), and I figure a topic that makes me very angry is as good as any to write about. I need strong emotions to motivate me to sit down and write, and income inequality is something that never fails to rile me up. 

I found <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/06/magazine/romneys-former-bain-partner-makes-a-case-for-inequality.html">This article</a> on my Facebook news feed this morning and disagreed with it entirely. The writer, Adam Davidson, interviewed 51-year-old Edward Conard, multi-millionaire former consultant for Bain Capital where he worked directly under Mitt Romney. He is now retired and writing books about how income inequality is actually really good for America. The writer of the article says of 1-percenters defending their claim to wealth, “They typically repeat platitudes about investment, risk-taking and job creation with the veiled contempt that the nation doesn’t understand their contribution. You get the sense that they’re afraid to say what they really believe.” And then Conard goes on to do exactly that: say that investment is good and the 99% just don’t understand how much the 1% so graciously provide for the rest. 

“Conard, however, has laid out a tightly argued case for just how much consumers actually benefit from the wealthy. Take computers, for example. A small number of innovators and investors may have earned disproportionate billions as the I.T. industry grew, but they got that money by competing to constantly improve their products and simultaneously lower prices. Their work has helped everyone get a lot more value. Cheap, improved computing helps us do our jobs more effectively and, often, earn more money.”

But that’s not “tightly argued” at all. The leaders and founders of the IT industry: Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Sergey Brin, Mark Zuckerberg, etc. were all self-made. They didn’t have huge capital investments right at the start, they had to work hard and be smart in order to innovate. What’s more, much of the Internet came from <i>government</i> investment. Not from private firms since they couldn’t see how to profit from it directly. And even further, if anything this technology makes the 99% earn less money as their jobs are replaced by computers.

He goes on to argue that investments by the wealthy have huge payoffs for the general public: “The idea that society benefits when investors compete successfully is pretty widely accepted. Dean Baker, a prominent progressive economist with the Center for Economic and Policy Research, says that most economists believe society often benefits from investments by the wealthy. Baker estimates the ratio is 5 to 1 … Conard concludes that for every dollar an investor gets, the public reaps up to 20 dollars in value.” Yeah, that 20 dollars in value that Mitt generated in the last 1.46 seconds ($21.6 million per year in income, 1/(21,600,000/365/24/60/60)) is really helping out the poor, black, American kid who doesn’t know where his next meal is coming from. But Conard doesn’t care at all about that kid: “he expressed anger over the praise that Warren Buffett has received for pledging billions of his fortune to charity. It was no sacrifice, Conard argued; Buffett still has plenty left over to lead his normal quality of life. By taking billions out of productive investment, he was depriving the middle class of the potential of its 20-to-1 benefits. If anyone was sacrificing, it was those people. ‘Quit taking a victory lap,’ he said, referring to Buffett. ‘That money was for the middle class.’”

Conard also argues that the people at the top should be making <i>even more</i> money in order to motivate more people to try to join them. I can basically quote the article wholesale here since his views are so ridiculous that I don’t even have to provide analysis: 

“A central problem with the U.S. economy, he told me, is finding a way to get more people to look for solutions despite these terrible odds of success. Conard’s solution is simple. Society benefits if the successful risk takers get a lot of money. For proof, he looks to the market. At a nearby table we saw three young people with plaid shirts and floppy hair. For all we know, they may have been plotting the next generation’s Twitter, but Conard felt sure they were merely lounging on the sidelines. “What are they doing, sitting here, having a coffee at 2:30?” he asked. “I’m sure those guys are college-educated.” Conard, who occasionally flashed a mean streak during our talks, started calling the group “art-history majors,” his derisive term for pretty much anyone who was lucky enough to be born with the talent and opportunity to join the risk-taking, innovation-hunting mechanism but who chose instead a less competitive life. In Conard’s mind, this includes, surprisingly, people like lawyers, who opt for stable professions that don’t maximize their wealth-creating potential. He said the only way to persuade these “art-history majors” to join the fiercely competitive economic mechanism is to tempt them with extraordinary payoffs.”

He’s proving right here that being a super-wealthy investor has been and always will be primarily about being rich. Not making a more efficient and productive and equal society. Money. He thinks that just because making money is the only thing that motivates <i>him</i> to succeed, produce, or do anything at all, that it must be that everyone is like that. He’s basically saying that the reason people major in art history is because they must want <i>more money than he has</i>. 

But his whole thing is bullshit anyway. He says that competition is the force for good that gives back to everyone (even though the people who need it least get back the most) but says that we need to “provide [the big banks] even stronger government support. He advocates creating a new government program that guarantees to bail out the banks if they ever face another run.” Even though according to him, if they failed, it must mean that they weren’t good enough to compete in the first place. And the hilarious part is then he says “Romney wants to eliminate capital-gains taxes for people earning less than $200,000 a year but keep them in place for the 1 percent, which Conard says is a good start but doesn’t go far enough.” So what Conard wants is no taxes on rich people so that they have all this money freed up to invest in risky ventures that the government will pay for when they fail. But if he doesn’t pay any taxes, where does he think the bailout money will come from? The middle class, which he is supposedly helping. 

Look, in the end, the reason this article made me so mad is because Conard is just another rich white guy touting the exact same slogans as all the other rich Republicans and they’re branding him as different even though he’s exactly the same. He’s advocating privatizing gains and socializing losses. He’s saying we should worship the rich for being so kind as to allow the byproducts of their ruthless money-grabbing to sometimes benefit other (white, American) people. America isn’t in the best shape right now, and Conard is saying that, while they stuff their wagons full of gold and dollar bills at everyone else’s expense, we should thank them personally when a bill or two happens to fall off on their way out of town.
