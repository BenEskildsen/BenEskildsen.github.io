			<h1>A Brief History of Japan pt. 1</h1>
			<h3>5/19/2014</h3>
		
As the second installment in my ongoing series where I try to update my blog once per week, I’ve decided to write out a quick history of Japan from ~1800 to 1945. Before this past semester, I knew basically nothing about Japan during this time period. And I won’t pretend to be an expert on it now, but two courses that I took at Yale this past semester taught me a ton about it: Japan’s Modern Revolution for pre-WWII era Japan, and The Balance of Power for Japan during the Second World War (both great classes with good professors that I highly recommend if you’re a shopping Yalie). The history that I’m about to write is going to be created largely off the top of my head and I will not really cite any sources. So while I want this to be informative, I will not pretend to be dictating straight facts, only the overall narrative as I understand it. Which will hopefully be more interesting to read anyway. 
<p></p>
Japan became a unified country in October of 1600 after the decisive battle of Sekigahara, where Tokugawa Ieyasu’s forces defeated the coalition of enemy lords that had formed to prevent his rise to power. After the battle, the Japanese state reorganized into one where the <i>shogun</i> (always a member of the Tokugawa family) was the de facto head of state, leading the country from Edo (Tokyo) and dictating his wishes to the <i>daimyo</i>, or lords, of Japan’s various domains, who would maintain their positions of power with the support of the samurai. Throughout this whole period, Japan also had an emperor who lived in Kyoto, but his role was purely symbolic as the shogun controlled the army and thus the means of implementing policy. 
<p></p>
From 1600 to 1868, the Tokugawa shoguns ruled Japan largely in peace. But even though the Japanese had a pretty good thing going on their island, the world around them was changing. In the sixteen and seventeen hundreds, the European nations were spreading feelers all over the world, probing foreign cultures for weaknesses. The shoguns quickly caught on to the Westerner’s game and banned Christianity from Japan and forced all European ships to dock at one single port in Nagasaki, where they could be heavily monitored. For some time, only the Dutch were allowed to trade with the Japanese, and even then only at one dock of the one port in Nagasaki. The idea was that the Europeans could not afford to fight a full-scale war on the other side of the world, and so they relied on the “divide and conquer” strategy of converting some of the foreigners to Christianity, and then using them to overthrow the local governments and set up colonies. So since the Japanese banned Christianity and constricted Western access to their ports, they actually ended up protecting themselves pretty effectively and cheaply.
<p></p>
But the Shoguns couldn’t maintain this peace indefinitely. Some people thought that the Shoguns weren’t tough enough on the “barbarians” and should ban them entirely. Others warned that it was only a matter of time before the Europeans, with their superior weaponry, invaded Japan and took the whole country outright. A faction of those people argued that instead of hating the foreigners unconditionally, the Japanese should learn as much as possible from the Westerners and use their own technology against them. This uneasiness and disagreement, combined with major crop failures and poor economic policies in the late 1700’s and early 1800’s set Japan into a state of disorder at the start of the 19th century. Furthermore, Japan’s old feudal system of samurai telling peasants what to do was falling apart from the bottom up: some peasants were accumulating lots of wealth and education, yet did not have the rights afforded to the hereditary samurai class, and they were upset as well. 
<p></p>
By the 1860’s, it was clear to those keeping up with the state of the government that Japan was on the verge of a major change. The Shogun tried to maintain order, saying that if the country fell into civil war, that it would be the perfect opportunity for the Europeans to swoop in and conquer everything. But some domains took matters into their own hands: soldiers in Satsuma killed an Englishman for not bowing to a samurai as he passed by, as was customary. The British retaliated by bombarding the town of Kagoshima from their gunboats, practically destroying the city. This incident proved two, conflicting, things: the Westerners were definitely the enemy, but without their technology, Japan didn’t stand a chance of ever defeating them. 
<p></p>
The country was descending into chaos. Members of the government were being assassinated more and more frequently. Mobs of young people were spontaneously dancing in the streets in what was called <i>ee ja nai ka</i>, or “why the Hell not”. And the people who were afraid of foreign invasion turned to the emperor for protection, using the slogan “revere the emperor, expel the barbarian!” Finally, in 1868, two powerful domains aligned themselves against the Shogun and used their own armies (which, importantly, consisted largely of non-samurai trained, ironically, in Western military tactics) to defeat the Shogun, who, after a brief civil war, resigned. As these rebellious domains had used the backing of the emperor to leverage support from the rest of the Japanese people, they symbolically restored the boy-emperor Meiji to power in what is now called, unsurprisingly, the Meiji Restoration. But in practice, a small group of bureaucratic oligarchs controlled the government after 1868.
<p></p>
After the Restoration, a huge fraction of the leaders of the government sailed around the world and visited most of the Western countries. When they returned, they realized just how behind they were when it came to industrial capacity and military might, and they completely overhauled the country over the course of the next three decades. 
<p></p>
It’s become clear the I have more to say than I anticipated (and I still left so much out!) and so I will have to split this post into two parts. But the takeaway from this half is that what is so interesting about Japan at the time of the Meiji Restoration is how all these different social movements with differing values and goals were able to briefly come together and reorganize the government. What was essentially a conservative revolution (“we need to go back to the time before 1600, when the emperor was in charge!” and “the Shogun isn’t tough enough on <strike>Communists</strike> Westerners, we gotta throw him out!”) ended up bringing about a ton of progressive change: Japan created a constitution and a parliament, made education compulsory, raised literacy levels to almost 100% by 1910, and caught up in modern medicine and steam technology. All in just a few decades. But that hint of authoritarianism carried through as well: the real control stayed in the hands of a few powerful oligarchs, and they took Western military technology and used it on their neighbors, defeating China and then Russia in the late 1890’s and early 1900’s. Japan’s thirst for empire would put them on a collision course with the United States that ended in 1945 with Japan on the brink of annihilation. 
<p></p>
But that’s for part 2.
